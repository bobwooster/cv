Dissertation: {\it Evolution Systems of Measures for Non-autonomous Stochastic Differential Equations with L\'evy Noise}, Advisor: Professor Maria Gordina.

My research was in the field of probability theory and stochastic differential equations.  Since stochastic differential involve randomness, they are used in a variety of applications including mathematical finance, biology, communications, and physics.  My work involved proving the existence and uniqueness of so-called \emph{evolution systems} of measures, an analog of steady-state or invariant measures, for non-autonomous equations.  These systems of measures play a large part in understanding the properties of solutions and determine their long term behavior.
